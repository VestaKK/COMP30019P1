# COMP30019 - Project 1 - Ray Tracer

This is your README.md... you should write anything relevant to your
implementation here.

Please ensure your student details are specified below (*exactly* as on UniMelb
records):

## Completed stages

Tick the stages bellow that you have completed so we know what to mark (by
editing README.md). **At most 9** marks can be chosen in total for stage
three. If you complete more than this many marks, pick your best one(s) to be
marked!

<!---
Tip: To tick, place an x between the square brackes [ ], like so: [x]
-->

##### Stage 1

- [x] Stage 1.1 - Familiarise yourself with the template
- [x] Stage 1.2 - Implement vector mathematics
- [x] Stage 1.3 - Fire a ray for each pixel
- [x] Stage 1.4 - Calculate ray-entity intersections
- [x] Stage 1.5 - Output primitives as solid colours

##### Stage 2

- [x] Stage 2.1 - Diffuse materials
- [x] Stage 2.2 - Shadow rays
- [x] Stage 2.3 - Reflective materials
- [x] Stage 2.4 - Refractive materials
- [x] Stage 2.5 - The Fresnel effect
- [x] Stage 2.6 - Anti-aliasing

##### Stage 3

- [ ] Option A - Emissive materials (+6)
- [ ] Option B - Ambient lighting/occlusion (+6)
- [x] Option C - OBJ models (+6)
- [ ] Option D - Glossy materials (+3)
- [x] Option E - Custom camera orientation (+3)
- [ ] Option F - Beer's law (+3)
- [ ] Option G - Depth of field (+3)

Please summarise your approach(es) to stage 3 here.*

OBJ models:
- Loaded in vertices, vertex normals and faces with simple string parsing
- Faces are stored as an array of Triangle primitives
- Triangles updated to store information about both vertexs and vertex normals
- Bool hasVertexNormals allows for conditional vertex normal interpolation for the
sake of 'smoother' shading of obj surface (since obj provides surface normals but
a normal triangle primitive doesn't)
- Optimised Obj ray collision detecting using AABB ray collision
- Using Multithreading to speed up obj triangle collision detection

Custom Camera orientation:
- Used Rodrigues' Rotation Formula using left handed coordinate system
- Applied extra logic to allow rotations from -360 -> 360 degress

## Final scene render

Be sure to replace ```/images/final_scene.png``` with your final render so it
shows up here.

![My final render](images/final_scene.png)

This render took **x** minutes and **y** seconds on my PC.

I used the following command to render the image exactly as shown:

```
dotnet run -- (... your command line args)
```

## Sample outputs

We have provided you with some sample tests located at ```/tests/*```. So you
have some point of comparison, here are the outputs our ray tracer solution
produces for given command line inputs (for the first two stages, left and right
respectively):

###### Sample 1

```
dotnet run -- -f tests/sample_scene_1.txt -o images/sample_scene_1.png -x 4
```

<p float="left">
  <img src="images/sample_scene_1_s1.png" />
  <img src="images/sample_scene_1_s2.png" /> 
</p>

###### Sample 2

```
dotnet run -- -f tests/sample_scene_2.txt -o images/sample_scene_2.png -x 4
```

<p float="left">
  <img src="images/sample_scene_2_s1.png" />
  <img src="images/sample_scene_2_s2.png" />
